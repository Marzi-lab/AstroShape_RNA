# AstroShape: BMP4 and CNTF differentiated astrocytes

## Data
Astrocytes were differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using medium containing ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) or bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) for 2-3 weeks. At 2 weeks, a subpopulation were treated with a reactivity factor for functional validation. **Bulk RNA-seq gene expression** data at both time points, with and without the reactivity factor, was generated to check astrocyte gene expression profiles.
